## üìò Key Concepts in Detail

### ‚úÖ 1. Execution Time (Response Time)

**Definition**:  
The total time a program takes to run from start to finish.

**Formula**:  

Execution Time = (Instruction Count √ó CPI) / Clock Rate


- **Instruction Count**: Number of instructions executed.
- **CPI**: Cycles per instruction.
- **Clock Rate**: Processor speed (e.g., 2 GHz = 2 √ó 10‚Åπ Hz).

> Lower execution time indicates better performance.

### ‚úÖ 2. CPI ‚Äì Cycles Per Instruction

**Definition**:  
Average number of clock cycles required to execute one instruction.

**Formula**:  

CPI = Total Clock Cycles / Instruction Count


> A lower CPI generally reflects a more efficient processor architecture.

### ‚úÖ 3. MIPS ‚Äì Million Instructions Per Second

**Definition**:  
Measures the number of instructions executed per second (in millions).

**Formula**:  

MIPS = Instruction Count / (Execution Time √ó 10^6)


> ‚ö†Ô∏è MIPS can be misleading across different architectures or programs with varying instruction complexity.

### ‚úÖ 4. IPC ‚Äì Instructions Per Cycle

**Definition**:  
Average number of instructions executed per CPU cycle.

**Formula**:
