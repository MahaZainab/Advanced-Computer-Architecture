## 📘 Key Concepts in Detail

### ✅ 1. Execution Time (Response Time)

**Definition**:  
The total time a program takes to run from start to finish.

**Formula**:  

Execution Time = (Instruction Count × CPI) / Clock Rate


- **Instruction Count**: Number of instructions executed.
- **CPI**: Cycles per instruction.
- **Clock Rate**: Processor speed (e.g., 2 GHz = 2 × 10⁹ Hz).

> Lower execution time indicates better performance.

### ✅ 2. CPI – Cycles Per Instruction

**Definition**:  
Average number of clock cycles required to execute one instruction.

**Formula**:
